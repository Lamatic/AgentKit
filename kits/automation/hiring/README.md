## Lamatic Setup (Pre and Post)

Before running this project, you must build and deploy the flow in Lamatic, then wire its config into this codebase.

Pre: Build in Lamatic
1. Sign in or sign up at https://lamatic.ai  
2. Create a project (if you don’t have one yet)  
3. Click “+ New Flow” and select "Templates" 
4. Select the 'Hiring' agent kit
5. Configure providers/tools/inputs as prompted  
6. Deploy the kit in Lamatic and obtain your .env keys
7. Copy the keys from your studio

Post: Wire into this repo
1. Create a .env file and set the keys
2. Install and run locally:
   - npm install
   - npm run dev
3. Deploy (Vercel recommended):
   - Import your repo, set the project’s Root Directory (if applicable)
   - Add env vars in Vercel (same as your .env)
   - Deploy and test your live URL

Notes
- Coming soon: single-click export and “Connect Git” in Lamatic to push config directly to your repo.

## 🔑 Setup
## Required Keys and Config

You’ll need two things to run this project locally:  

1. **.env Keys** → get it from your [Lamatic account](https://lamatic.ai) post kit deployment.
2. Vercel Blob Token – Required for resume file storage. Each deployment needs its own Blob token. You can generate it from your Vercel project after the first deploy (see instructions below).


| Item              | Purpose                                      | Where to Get It                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| .env Key  | Authentication for Lamatic AI APIs and Orchestration           | [lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai)                |
| Blob Read/Write Token   | Resume file storage                          | [Vercel Blob Quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/quickstart)                    |

### 1. Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with:

```bash
# Lamatic
AUTOMATION_HIRING = "AUTOMATION_HIRING Flow ID"
LAMATIC_API_URL = "LAMATIC_API_URL"
LAMATIC_PROJECT_ID = "LAMATIC_PROJECT_ID"
LAMATIC_API_KEY = "LAMATIC_API_KEY"

# Vercel Blob (configured on Vercel)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_blob_token
```

### 2. Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Deploy Instructions (Vercel)

Click the “Deploy with Vercel” button.

Fill in .env Keys from lamatic (required).

For BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN, you can use a placeholder to let the first deploy succeed.

After deployment, generate your own Blob token:

```bash
vercel storage blob token create
```

Add/Replace it in Vercel Dashboard → Environment Variables → BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN and redeploy.

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding Jobs

```typescript
export const jobsData: JobCategory[] = [
  {
    id: "engineering",
    name: "Engineering",
    jobs: [
      {
        id: "senior-frontend",
        title: "Senior Frontend Developer",
        category: "Engineering",

      }
    ]
  }
]
```
