## Lamatic Setup (Pre and Post)

Before running this project, you must build and deploy the flow in Lamatic, then wire its config into this codebase.

Pre: Build in Lamatic
1. Sign in or sign up at https://app.lamatic.ai  
2. Create a project (if you don’t have one yet)  
3. Click “+ New Flow”  
4. Choose “Build from Use Cases” and select the kit closest to your needs  
5. Configure providers/tools/inputs as prompted  
6. Deploy the flow in Lamatic and verify it runs  
7. Export the lamatic-config.json from your deployed flow

Post: Wire into this repo
1. Place lamatic-config.json in the path this repo expects (commonly ./lamatic-config.json; if different, follow this README’s instructions)  
2. Create a .env file and set:
   - LAMATIC_API_KEY=your_lamatic_key
   - Any other provider keys your flow requires (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
3. Install and run locally:
   - npm install
   - npm run dev
4. Deploy (Vercel recommended):
   - Import your repo, set the project’s Root Directory (if applicable)
   - Add env vars in Vercel (same as your .env)
   - Deploy and test your live URL

Notes
- If this repo contains a lamatic-config.json, it’s a placeholder. Replace it with your exported config.  
- Coming soon: single-click export and “Connect Git” in Lamatic to push config directly to your repo.

## 🔑 Setup

## Required Keys and Config

You'll need the following to run this project locally:

1. **Lamatic API Key** → get it from your [Lamatic account](https://lamatic.ai)
2. **Blob Token** → automatically provided when deploying to Vercel, or create one in your Vercel dashboard or locally
3. **lamatic-config.json payload** → copy it from your Lamatic Studio project (this defines the image generation flow)
   ⚠️ Note: The `lamatic-config.json` in this repo contains the Halloween costume generation workflow.

| Item                    | Purpose                                      | Where to Get It                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Lamatic API Key         | Authentication for Lamatic AI APIs           | [lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai)                |
| Blob Token       | Image storage and retrieval                  | Blob Token   |
| Lamatic Config          | Defines your costume generation flow         | From your Lamatic Studio Agent Kit Project      |

### 1. Environment Variables

Create `.env` with:

```bash
# Lamatic
LAMATIC_API_KEY=your_lamatic_key

# Vercel Blob (for image storage)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_blob_token
```

### 2. Config File

The [`lamatic-config.json`](./lamatic-config.json) file contains the Halloween costume generation workflow configuration. This defines:
- Image generation flow with workflowId: `42dafbda-3b5e-421f-aeac-29f3156febeb`
- Input schema: `image` (base64) and `theme` (string)
- Output: Multiple costume variations (image, img1-img7)

You can customize this by exporting your own workflow from Lamatic Studio.

### 3. Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```
### 4. Deploy Instructions (Vercel)

Click the “Deploy with Vercel” button.

Fill in LAMATIC_API_KEY (required).

For BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN, you can use a placeholder to let the first deploy succeed.

After deployment, generate your own Blob token:

```bash
vercel storage blob token create
```

Add/Replace it in Vercel Dashboard → Environment Variables → BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN and redeploy.
